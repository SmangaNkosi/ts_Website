Hi! I'm Tsepo Nkosi.

I'm someone who loves exploring the world of machine learning and discovering how technology can solve real-world problems.
This website is a place where I share my journey, document what I learn, and showcase some of the projects I'm working on.
Feel free to look around the site.
