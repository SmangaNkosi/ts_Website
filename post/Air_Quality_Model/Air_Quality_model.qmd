The air quality of 5 major US cities was collected over a period of 13 years, 2012 to 2024 on a day by day interval.
These cities are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houstan, and Phoenix. 

Six predictors where mearsured, Pm2.5(particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers), Pm10(particles smaller than 10 micrometers), No2(Nitrogen dioxide in ppb), So2(Sulfur dioxide in ppb), co(Carbon monoxide in ppm), and Aqi(Air Quality Index)
